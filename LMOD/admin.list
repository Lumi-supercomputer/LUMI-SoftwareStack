LUMI/21.12:
The LUMI/21.12 software stack has reached the end of its supported life. The
necessary compilers are no longer on the system but the module system as been tweaked
to load other modules so that software installed with 21.12 may still work. However,
we do no longer support running that software and the default answer to a complaint
is "Recompile with 22.08 or newer". 

LUMI/22.06:
The LUMI/22.06 software stack has reached the end of its supported life. The
necessary compilers are no longer on the system but the module system as been tweaked
to load other modules so that software installed with 21.12 may still work. However,
we do no longer support running that software and the default answer to a complaint
is "Recompile with 22.08 or newer". 

rocm/5.2.5:
This module is not installed the way it is intended by AMD. Hence some parts of ROCm may
be broken or offer slower than expected performance and there is nothing the LUMI
User Support Team can do about that. As the module is also not an official HPE Cray 
module there is no guarantee that it will integrate properly with HPE Cray PE modules
or work correctly in that environment. It may be safer to simply use rocm/5.2.3 which
is provided by HPE unless you are hit by specific bugs in that version.

rocm/5.3.3:
This module is not installed the way it is intended by AMD. Hence some parts of ROCm may
be broken or offer slower than expected performance and there is nothing the LUMI
User Support Team can do about that. As the module is also not an official HPE Cray 
module there is no guarantee that it will integrate properly with HPE Cray PE modules
or work correctly in that environment. Note that HPE Cray PE programming environments
up to at least 23.02 have only been tested with ROCm version prior to 5.3 by HPE.

Rust/1.60.0:
The Rust 1.60.0 module is known to be faulty and will be removed from the system. As
Rust is difficult to support and not a typical HPC language, it is removed from the
pre-installed central software stack and we try to offer occasional support via the
contributed EasyBuild recipes.
