LUMI/22.08:
The LUMI/22.08 stack does not work anymore as essential components are no
longer on the system. This module will be removed soon.

LUMI/22.12:
The LUMI/22.12 stack does not work anymore as essential components are no
longer on the system. This module will be removed soon.

LUMI/23.03:
The LUMI/23.03 stack does not work anymore as essential components are no
longer on the system. This module will be removed soon.

LUMI/23.09:
The LUMI/23.09 stack is now totally unsupported. It was designed to be used
with ROCm 5.5.1 and not the ROCm version we have now on the system, and was
also never tested with this version of SUSE Linux. Use at your own risk, but
the LUMI User Support Team will not solve any issue with it, and HPE and
AMD will also not solve any issues.

LUMI/23.12:
The LUMI/23.12 stack does not work anymore as essential components are no
longer on the system. This module will be removed soon.

LUMI/24.03:
The LUMI/24.03 stack is currently unsupported as it was never tested with
the version of ROCm that is now on the system (and the version it was 
designed for is actually too old for the current GPU driver). Due to the OS 
and network stack update, we can also not guarantee that CPU-only software 
will still work as intended.

rocm/6.[1-2].*singularity.*:
These containers should be fine with the ROCm driver on LUMI, but interfacing
with the Cray PE outside the container may not always work as expected. Note 
that after the January 2026 update, they also have to work with a different
kernel, network drivers and GPU driver then before, so containers that worked
before that update may now have issues.

rocm/5.[4-7].*singularity.*:
The ROCm version in these containers is not supported by the ROCm driver on LUMI,
so some features might be broken.

rocm/6.0.*singularity.*:
The ROCm version in these containers is not supported by the ROCm driver on LUMI,
so some features might be broken.

rocm/5.2.5:
The ROCm 5.2.5 module is no longer supported on LUMI as it is too old for the
current driver version.

rocm/5.3.3:
The ROCm 5.2.5 module is no longer supported on LUMI as it is too old for the
current driver version.

rocm/5.4.6:
The ROCm 5.2.5 module is no longer supported on LUMI as it is too old for the
current driver version.

rocm/5.6.1:
The ROCm 5.2.5 module is no longer supported on LUMI as it is too old for the
current driver version.

amd/5.6.1:
The ROCm 5.2.5 module is no longer supported on LUMI as it is too old for the
current driver version.

rocm/6.2.2:
This module is not installed the way it is intended by AMD. Hence some parts of ROCm may
be broken or offer slower than expected performance and there is nothing the LUMI
User Support Team can do about that. As the module is also not an official HPE Cray 
module there is no guarantee that it will integrate properly with HPE Cray PE modules
or work correctly in that environment. In fact, it is know to cause problems with the
CCE compilers prior to cce/18.0.0 due to link incompatibilities. Note that hipSolver now
requires SuiteSparse, and since that one uses BLAS and LAPACK, it depends on the
programming environment so is a separate module that needs to be loaded if you use
hipSolver.

.*/.*%-rocm%-5.[2-7].*%-singularity%-.*:
The container module you're loading is for a container based on a ROCm version that
is no longer supported by the GPU driver. Only containers with ROCm versions between
6.1 and 6.4 can be used.

.*/.*%-rocm%-6.0.*%-singularity%-.*:
The container module you're loading is for a container based on a ROCm version that
is no longer supported by the GPU driver. Only containers with ROCm versions between
6.1 and 6.4 can be used.

.*/.*%-rocm%-6.[1-2].*%-singularity%-.*:
Though this container is based on a version of ROCm that is officially supported
by the ROCm driver on the system, we cannot exclude that there will be problems
when, e.g., the container integrates with the Cray PE as it may be trying to
link to libraries that were meant to be used with a different version of ROCm.
In particular, we expect that mpi4py may produce warnings.

Rust/1.60.0:
The Rust 1.60.0 module is known to be faulty and will be removed from the system. As
Rust is difficult to support and not a typical HPC language, it is removed from the
pre-installed central software stack and we try to offer occasional support via the
contributed EasyBuild recipes.

spack/22.08.*:
The spack/22.08 modules are no longer supported as essential system components are no
longer on the system.

spack/23.03.*:
The spack/23.03 modules are no longer supported as essential system components are no
longer on the system.

spack/23.09:
The Spack module based on the 23.09 programming environment is deprecated as we cannot
guarantee that the compiler and MPI library will work on the updated LUMI system. The
stack will be removed when we are confident that a spack setup based on 24.03 is in
a sufficient state to be used and has been available for some time.

lumi%-container%-wrapper/0%.[2-3]%..*:
This version of lumi-container-wrapper is deprecated. Please switch to version 0.4.2 or
newer, available in CrayEnv and LUMI/24.03 or newer. Please also take note of license 
issues when using with anaconda, as mentioned in the user documentation section of 
https://lumi-supercomputer.github.io/LUMI-EasyBuild-docs/l/lumi-container-wrapper/ .

ccpe/25.03%-.*:
We recommend using this module only if you want to extend the container or believe this
is a way to keep your software running after the next update.

EasyBuild/4.9.4:
The 25.03 stack was initially developed with EasyBuild 4.9.4 and the module is still
present for testing and debugging purposes. However, EasyConfigs have been adapted
to EasyBuild 5 and some may even not work anymore with EasyBuild 4.9.4.

cray-python/3.10.10:
The mpi4py package in this version of Cray Python is incompatible with the current
network stack. The only solution is to move to a newer version of Cray Python. No fix 
will be made available.

cray-mpich/8.1.27:
This version of the MPI library which came with the currently unsupported 23.09 version
of the programming environment, is no longer compatible with the network stack on the
system. For users of the GNU compilers, there is no solution. Users of other compilers:
Unless you use rpath linking or prepend/append CRAY_LD_LIBRARYPATH to LD_LIBRARYPATH, 
programs will likely run as they will effectively use the MPI libraries from the 
default version of the programming environment. If you don't understand this text, then
you should start using version 25.03 of the programming environment as you will have more
issues.
