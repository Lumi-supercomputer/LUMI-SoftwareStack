ModuleExtensions/.*:
Unfortunately due to problems with Cray LMOD this module does not yet have the desired effect.
We are looking for a solution but don't expect anything soon.

LUMI/21.08:
The LUMI/21.08 software stack is currently hidden and broken due to missing components on the 
system after the upgrade in early July. It will work for some users but not all, so try at your
own risk. It will not be possible to offer this stack again. Users should move to 21.12 in the
short term and to 22.08 in the longer term (or if it already satisfies your needs).
Do not to attempt to recompile software with 21.08, as you will get unexpected results.

partition/EAP:
The MI100 based Early Access Platform is currently out of service, and replaced by a few regular
MI250X nodes of LUMI-G. For these nodes, partition/G should be used instead (and will be loaded
automatically if you load a LUMI module on those nodes).

rocm/4.5.2:
This module is only suited for use with the cpe/21.12 compilers, and its use is discouraged.
MPI may fail as the default MPI library which is used expects a different version of rocm.
Users are advised to switch to the cpe/22.08 programming environment which is the default 
since August 18 and use rocm/5.0.2.

rocm/5.1.4:
This module is only suited for use with the cpe/22.06 compilers, and its use is discouraged.
MPI may fail as the default MPI library which is used expects a different version of rocm.
Users are advised to switch to the cpe/22.08 programming environment which is the default
since August 18 and use rocm/5.0.2.

rocmlibs/4.5.2:
This module is no longer supported on the system. Users are advised to switch to the 22.08
programming environment which is the default since August 18. The functionality of this
module is now provided by rocm/5.0.2.

RCCL/4.5.2:
This module is no longer supported on the system. Users are advised to switch to the 22.08
programming environment which is the default since August 18. The functionality of this
module is now provided by rocm/5.0.2.

rocThrust/4.5.2:
This module is no longer supported on the system. Users are advised to switch to the 22.08
programming environment which is the default since August 18. The functionality of this
module is now provided by rocm/5.0.2.

partition/G:
There is currently no support for GPU software building in partition/G. It is still under
development. Users may need to augment the environment by hand. It may be better to use 
CrayEnv instead. Partiton/G will only become officially available when production use starts.
