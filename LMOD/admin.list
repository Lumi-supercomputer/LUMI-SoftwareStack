LUMI/21.12:
This software stack which has been deprecated for a while will be removed from
the system at the next system upgrade.

LUMI/22.06:
This software stack which has been deprecated for a while will be removed from
the system at the next system upgrade.

LUMI/22.08:
The LUMI/22.08 is approaching end-of-life fast. It will likely not work anymore
after the system updated planned for late August and early September. If your
project is still active after that system update, we encourage you to switch
to LUMI/23.09. See also the mail on the users mailing list of May 21.

LUMI/22.12:
The LUMI/22.12 is approaching end-of-life fast. It will likely not work anymore
after the system updated planned for late August and early September. If your
project is still active after that system update, we encourage you to switch
to LUMI/23.09. See also the mail on the users mailing list of May 21.

rocm/5.4.*singularity.*:
These containers should be fine with the ROCm driver on LUMI, but interfacing
with the Cray PE outside the container may not work as expected.

rocm/5.[5-7].*singularity.*:
The ROCm version in these containers is not supported by the ROCm driver on LUMI,
so some features might be broken. Some problems we know of are documented on
https://lumi-supercomputer.github.io/LUMI-EasyBuild-docs/r/rocm/

rocm/5.2.5:
This module is not installed the way it is intended by AMD. Hence some parts of ROCm may
be broken or offer slower than expected performance and there is nothing the LUMI
User Support Team can do about that. As the module is also not an official HPE Cray 
module there is no guarantee that it will integrate properly with HPE Cray PE modules
or work correctly in that environment. It may be safer to simply use rocm/5.2.3 which
is provided by HPE unless you are hit by specific bugs in that version.

rocm/5.3.3:
This module is not installed the way it is intended by AMD. Hence some parts of ROCm may
be broken or offer slower than expected performance and there is nothing the LUMI
User Support Team can do about that. As the module is also not an official HPE Cray 
module there is no guarantee that it will integrate properly with HPE Cray PE modules
or work correctly in that environment. Note that HPE Cray PE programming environments
up to at least 23.02 have only been tested with ROCm version prior to 5.3 by HPE.

rocm/5.4.6:
This module is not installed the way it is intended by AMD. Hence some parts of ROCm may
be broken or offer slower than expected performance and there is nothing the LUMI
User Support Team can do about that. As the module is also not an official HPE Cray 
module there is no guarantee that it will integrate properly with HPE Cray PE modules
or work correctly in that environment. Officially supported ROCm versions for the
HPE Cray PE version 23.09 or 5.2 on the OS version on LUMI and 5.5 on the newer
OS version, so likely everything is mostly fine.

rocm/5.6.1:
The ROCm 5.6.1 module comes without warranty nor support as it is not installed in
the regular directories as suggested by AMD, which may break links encoded in RPMs.
It is also not officially supported by the driver version currently on the system
(which we cannot update at the moment), and is also not officially supported by HPE.
We have observed problems, see the ROCm page in the LUMI Software Library:
https://lumi-supercomputer.github.io/LUMI-EasyBuild-docs/r/rocm/

amd/5.6.1:
This module mimics the behaviour of the HPE CPE amd modules but cannot fully work
in the same way, so problems may occur. Also check the instructions in the LUMI
Software Library at https://lumi-supercomputer.github.io/LUMI-EasyBuild-docs/a/amd.

.*/.*%-rocm%-5.[5-7].*%-singularity%-.*:
These containers are based on newer versions of ROCm than officially supported by
the ROCm driver on the system, so some features may be broken. These containers,
when offered through the LUMI Software Library, are offered as a convenience but
without guarantee that the LUMI User Support Team can fix all problems with them
due to the mismatch between ROCM driver and libraries versions.
We have observed problems, see the ROCm page in the LUMI Software Library:

Rust/1.60.0:
The Rust 1.60.0 module is known to be faulty and will be removed from the system. As
Rust is difficult to support and not a typical HPC language, it is removed from the
pre-installed central software stack and we try to offer occasional support via the
contributed EasyBuild recipes.
