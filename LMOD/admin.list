LUMI/22.08:
The LUMI/22.08 stack has reached end-of-life and will be removed after the 
sJanuary 2026 system update.

LUMI/22.12:
The LUMI/22.12 stack has reached end-of-life and will be removed after the 
January 2026 system update.

LUMI/23.03:
The LUMI/23.03 stack has reached end-of-life and will be removed after the 
January 2026 system update.

LUMI/23.09:
Though before the summer-of-2024 system update we expected to be capable to
support this LUMI stack longer, the choice for ROCm 6.0 rather than 5.7 may
cause problems that we cannot fix and may require updating to 24.03.
We expect that the problems will only get worse after the January 2026 
update. This toolchain will remain on the system during the January 2026
update, but is fully unsupported by LUST, HPE and AMD.

LUMI/23.12:
The LUMI/23.12 stack has reached end-of-life and will be removed after the 
January 2026 system update.

LUMI/24.03:
The LUMI/24.03 stack remains on the system also after the January 2026 system
update, but will be unsupported afterwards as it is based on a version of 
ROCm that will be unsupported by the ROCm drivers. Due to the OS and network
stack update, we can also not guarantee that CPU-only software will still
work as intended.

cpe/22.08
The 22.08 version of the HPE Cray Programming Environment will be removed from
the system in the January 2026 update.

cpe/22.12
The 22.12 version of the HPE Cray Programming Environment will be removed from
the system in the January 2026 update.

cpe/23.03
The 23.03 version of the HPE Cray Programming Environment will be removed from
the system in the January 2026 update.

cpe/23.12
The 23.12 version of the HPE Cray Programming Environment will be removed from
the system in the January 2026 update.

rocm/6.[1-2].*singularity.*:
These containers should be fine with the ROCm driver on LUMI, but interfacing
with the Cray PE outside the container may not always work as expected.

rocm/5.[6-7].*singularity.*:
These containers should be fine with the ROCm driver on LUMI, but interfacing
with the Cray PE outside the container may not always work as expected.

rocm/5.[4-5].*singularity.*:
The ROCm version in these containers is not supported by the ROCm driver on LUMI,
so some features might be broken.

rocm/5.2.5:
The ROCm 5.6.1 module comes without warranty nor support as it is not installed in
the regular directories as suggested by AMD, which may break links encoded in RPMs.
It is also not officially supported by the driver version currently on the system
(which we cannot update at the moment), and is also not officially supported by HPE.
When we observe problems, we'll document then on the ROCm page in the LUMI Software 
Library: https://lumi-supercomputer.github.io/LUMI-EasyBuild-docs/r/rocm/

rocm/5.3.3:
The ROCm 5.6.1 module comes without warranty nor support as it is not installed in
the regular directories as suggested by AMD, which may break links encoded in RPMs.
It is also not officially supported by the driver version currently on the system
(which we cannot update at the moment), and is also not officially supported by HPE.
When we observe problems, we'll document then on the ROCm page in the LUMI Software 
Library: https://lumi-supercomputer.github.io/LUMI-EasyBuild-docs/r/rocm/

rocm/5.4.6:
The ROCm 5.6.1 module comes without warranty nor support as it is not installed in
the regular directories as suggested by AMD, which may break links encoded in RPMs.
It is also not officially supported by the driver version currently on the system
(which we cannot update at the moment), and is also not officially supported by HPE.
When we observe problems, we'll document then on the ROCm page in the LUMI Software 
Library: https://lumi-supercomputer.github.io/LUMI-EasyBuild-docs/r/rocm/

rocm/5.6.1:
This module is not installed the way it is intended by AMD. Hence some parts of ROCm may
be broken or offer slower than expected performance and there is nothing the LUMI
User Support Team can do about that. As the module is also not an official HPE Cray 
module there is no guarantee that it will integrate properly with HPE Cray PE modules
or work correctly in that environment. 

amd/5.6.1:
This module mimics the behaviour of the HPE CPE amd modules but cannot fully work
in the same way, so problems may occur. Also check the instructions in the LUMI
Software Library at https://lumi-supercomputer.github.io/LUMI-EasyBuild-docs/a/amd.

rocm/6.2.2:
This module is not installed the way it is intended by AMD. Hence some parts of ROCm may
be broken or offer slower than expected performance and there is nothing the LUMI
User Support Team can do about that. As the module is also not an official HPE Cray 
module there is no guarantee that it will integrate properly with HPE Cray PE modules
or work correctly in that environment. In fact, it is know to cause problems with the
CCE compilers prior to cce/18.0.0 due to link incompatibilities. Note that hipSolver now
requires SuiteSparse, and since that one uses BLAS and LAPACK, it depends on the
programming environment so is a separate module that needs to be loaded if you use
hipSolver.

.*/.*%-rocm%-5.[2-5].*%-singularity%-.*:
These containers are based on older versions of ROCm than officially supported by
the ROCm driver on the system, so some features may be broken. These containers,
when offered through the LUMI Software Library, are offered as a convenience but
without guarantee that the LUMI User Support Team can fix all problems with them
due to the mismatch between ROCM driver and libraries versions.

.*/.*%-rocm%-5.[6-7].*%-singularity%-.*:
Though this container is based on a version of ROCm that is officially supported
by the ROCm driver on the system, we cannot exclude that there will be problems
when, e.g., the container integrates with the Cray PE as it may be trying to
link to libraries that were meant to be used with a different version of ROCm.
In particular, we expect that mpi4py may produce warnings.

.*/.*%-rocm%-6.[1-2].*%-singularity%-.*:
Though this container is based on a version of ROCm that is officially supported
by the ROCm driver on the system, we cannot exclude that there will be problems
when, e.g., the container integrates with the Cray PE as it may be trying to

In particular, we expect that mpi4py may produce warnings.

Rust/1.60.0:
The Rust 1.60.0 module is known to be faulty and will be removed from the system. As
Rust is difficult to support and not a typical HPC language, it is removed from the
pre-installed central software stack and we try to offer occasional support via the
contributed EasyBuild recipes.

spack/22.08.*:
Spack modules based on the 22.08 programming environment will be removed from the system
soon as this programming environment doesn't function well anymore. Please prepare to
rebuild with a newer version (preferably 24.03 as soon as a spack setup based on this
version becomes available).

spack/23.03.*:
Spack modules based on the 23.03 programming environment will be removed from the system
soon as this programming environment doesn't function well anymore. Please prepare to
rebuild with a newer version (preferably 24.03 as soon as a spack setup based on this
version becomes available).

spack/23.09:
The Spack module based on the 23.09 programming environment is deprecated as we cannot
guarantee that the compiler and MPI library will work on the updated LUMI system. The
stack will be removed when we are confident that a spack setup based on 24.03 is in
a sufficient state to be used and has been available for some time.

lumi%-container%-wrapper/0%.[2-3]%..*:
This version of lumi-container-wrapper is deprecated. Please switch to version 0.4.2 or
newer, available in CrayEnv and LUMI/24.03 or newer. Please also take note of license 
issues when using with anaconda, as mentioned in the user documentation section of 
https://lumi-supercomputer.github.io/LUMI-EasyBuild-docs/l/lumi-container-wrapper/ .

ccpe/25.03-.*:
This module also serves as a preview of the software stack for 25.03. Note
however that GPU software may not work properly due to driver incompatibilities
that cannot be solved with a container.

EasyBuild/4.9.4:
The 25.03 stack was initially developed with EasyBuild 4.9.4 and the module is still
present for testing and debugging purposes. However, EasyConfigs have been adapted
to EasyBuild 5 and some may even not work anymore with EasyBuild 4.9.4.
