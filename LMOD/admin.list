ModuleExtensions/.*:
Unfortunately due to problems with Cray LMOD this module does not yet have the desired effect.
We are looking for a solution but don't expect anything soon.

LUMI/21.12:
The LUMI/21.12 software stack is nearing the end of its supported life as we cannot guarantee
that it can be kept available after the next major system update planned for March 2023.
Please move to 22.08 which we will try to keep available and is now the default.

LUMI/22.06:
The LUMI/22.06 software stack is nearing the end of its supported life as we cannot guarantee
that it can be kept available after the next major system update planned for March 2023.
Please move to 22.08 which we will try to keep available.

rocm/5.2.5:
This module is not installed the way it is intended by AMD. Hence some parts of ROCm may
be broken or offer slower than expected performance and there is nothing the LUMI
User Support Team can do about that. As the module is also not an official HPE Cray 
module there is no guarantee that it will integrate properly with HPE Cray PE modules
or work correctly in that environment. It may be safer to simply use rocm/5.2.3 which
is provided by HPE unless you are hit by specific bugs in that version.

rocm/5.3.3:
This module is not installed the way it is intended by AMD. Hence some parts of ROCm may
be broken or offer slower than expected performance and there is nothing the LUMI
User Support Team can do about that. As the module is also not an official HPE Cray 
module there is no guarantee that it will integrate properly with HPE Cray PE modules
or work correctly in that environment. Note that HPE Cray PE programming environments
up to at least 23.02 have only been tested with ROCm version prior to 5.3 by HPE.
