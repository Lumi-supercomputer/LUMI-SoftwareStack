You can check your quota on LUMI using the lumi-workspaces command that you
can find in the lumi-workspaces module in the LUMI and CrayEnv environments.

=====

The preferred way to use compilers on a Cray system is through one of the
PrgEnv modules: PrgEnv-gnu for the GNU compilers, PRgEnv-cray for the Cray
compilers, and PrgEnv-aocc for the AMD compilers. The compilers are then
called through wrapper scripts: cc for the C compiler, CC for the C++
compiler and ftn for the Fortran compiler.

=====

There is no need to specify a target with the compiler wrappers as they
determine the target from the loaded craype-x86-* module. Compiling for MPI
is automatically enabled when a cray-mpich module is loaded, and the Cray
LibSci library (which contains BLAS, LAPACK and ScaLAPACK) is automatically
linked when the cray-libsci module is loaded.

=====

LUMI has no mpirun or mpiexec command. MPI programs are started using the
Slurm srun command.

The preferred way to contact the LUMI User Support Team is using the forms on
https://lumi-supercomputer.eu/user-support/need-help/. Please don't recycle an
old ticket for a new request but fill in the form again. This ensures the
proper handling of your request. LUMI user support is active on workdays
from 8am till 6 pm central-European time so covers the regular 9-to-5 business
hours in all cournties of EuroHPC.

LUMI is an abbreviation of Large Unified Modern Infrastructure. The LUMI
consortium countries are Finland, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia,
Iceland, Norway, Poland, Sweden, and Switzerland.

LUMI means snow in Finnish. Snow has also inspired the look of the LUMI data
center.

=====

LUMI uses warm-water cooling, which enables its waste heat to be utilized in the
district heating network of the city of Kajaani, and thus replaces heat produced
by fossil fuels.

The waste heat from LUMI that can be used in Kajaani’s district heating network
is equivalent to up to 20 per cent of the energy that Kajaani needs to use in
the area’s district heating. This reuse of waste heat will reduce the annual
carbon dioxide footprint of Kajaani by 13,500 tons – an amount that equals the
output from 4000 passenger cars.

=====

The CrayEnv stack is our solution to use the Cray Programming Environment fully
as intended by Cray. However, when using the LUMI software stack, it is better to
use the cpeGNU or cpeCray modules to load the GNU respectively the Cray compilers
in your environnment as that guarantees a setup that is compatible with the
cpeGNU and cpeCray modules respectively. You're free to do otherwise if you're
an experienced user, but you have to realise that not all combinations of
compiler and software modules will work.

=====

With software built with EasyBuild (as is most software in the LUMI stack),
it is very easy to find the location of the software binaries. After loading
the module, an environment variable based on the name of the module will be
defined. E.g., after loading one of the Boost modules, the location of
Boost will be given by the EBROOTBOOST environment variable. Try
  env | egrep ^EBROOT
in a shell to see all EBROOT variables that are defined after loading some
modules.
