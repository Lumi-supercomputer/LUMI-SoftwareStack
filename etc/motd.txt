   .Announcements---------------------------------------------------.
*  | The default version of the LUMI software stack will switch     |
   | to 23.09 to align with the current default version of the Cray |
 * | PE and because it is likely the only current stack that we     |
   | will still be able to support after the next major system      |
  *| update. If your project ends after the end of August this      |
   | year, we encourage you to switch to LUMI/23.09 if you're using |
 * | the LUMI stacks, spack/23.09 if you're using Spack, or the     |
   | default 23.09 compilers in CrayEnv or the bare system. Feel    |
*  | free to contact support if you feel some software supported    |
   | by us in 22.08 or 22.12 is not yet in 23.09 as now there is    |
 * | still time to do something about it. You can keep using the    |
   | older stacks until the system update, but please make sure you |
   | explicitly use LUMI/22.08 and not LUMI without version when    |
 * | you load the LUMI stack or the behaviour will change. The      |
   | projected date for the switch of the default for LUMI is       |
   | July 9, 2024.                                                  |
  *|                                                                |
*  | You can use the lumi-workspaces command (without loading an    |
   | additional module) to check your quota and allocations on      |
   | LUMI. Also check `module help lumi-tools` for more info.       | 
*  .Notes-----------------------------------------------------------.
   | Make sure one of the following modules is loaded to have the   |
 * | full LUMI experience:                                          |
   | - CrayEnv: The Cray software stack enriched with some          |
   |   additional tools not installed by default in the OS          |
*  | - LUMI: The extensible LUMI software stack that you can use    |
   |   as a basis for additional software installs with EasyBuild   |
 * |   and other tools.                                             |
*  | - spack: If you are an experienced Spack user and know how it  |
   |   works. Spack is offered as-is. We do not do development or   |
  *|   bug fixing in Spack but do offer a configuration compatible  |
** |   with the Cray PE.                                            |
