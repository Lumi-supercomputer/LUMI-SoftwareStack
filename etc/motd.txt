 * | IMPORTANT: Check the post-maintenance updates on               |
 * | https://lumi-supercomputer.github.io/update-202409/            |
   |                                                                |
*  | NOTE: The default version of both the Cray PE and LUMI stack   |
   | is now 24.03 and this is also the only version of the Cray PE  |
  *| officially supported on the current system. We recommend       |
   | moving to 24.03 when possible. This will also offer the        |
   | smoothest path for the next update.                            |
*  |                                                                |
   | There is a system update planned for January 7-21, 2026,       |
 * | which will bring ROCm 6.3 on the system (based on LLVM 18)     |
 * | and CCE 19. Software installed on the system before the update |
   | may require recompilation in the new programming environment.  |
   | The 23.09 and 24.03 stacks will remain on the system but in an |
*  | unsupported state while other versions of the HPE Cray PE will |
   | be removed from the system (with their corresponding software  |
  *| stacks). Containers based on ROCm 6.1 or 6.2 will likely still |
   | function after the system update.                              |
*  |                                                                |
   | You can use the lumi-workspaces command (without loading an    |
   | additional module) to check your quota and allocations on      |
  *| LUMI. Also check `module help lumi-tools` for more info.       | 
   |                                                                |
   | Note that LUMI users are responsible for verifying software    |
*  | licenses for the packages they use and must also obey to all   |
   | export restriction laws and other regulations imposed by the   |
   | EU, Finland, and USA. Countries from which LUMI is forbidden   |
 * | include Belarus, China, Iran and Russia, but this list is.     |
   | non-exhaustive and restrictions includes all countries under   |
   | EU or USA sanction affecting computer technology, including    |
   | hardware and software for AI.                                  |
*  .Notes-----------------------------------------------------------.
   | Make sure one of the following modules is loaded to have the   |
 * | full LUMI experience:                                          |
   | - CrayEnv: The Cray software stack enriched with some          |
   |   additional tools not installed by default in the OS          |
*  | - LUMI: The extensible LUMI software stack that you can use    |
   |   as a basis for additional software installs with EasyBuild   |
 * |   and other tools.                                             |
*  | - spack: If you are an experienced Spack user and know how it  |
   |   works. Spack is offered as-is. We do not do development or   |
  *|   bug fixing in Spack but do offer a configuration compatible  |
** |   with the Cray PE.                                            |
