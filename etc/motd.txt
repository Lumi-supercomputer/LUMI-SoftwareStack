   .Announcements---------------------------------------------------.
 * | IMPORTANT: Check the post-maintenance updates on               |
 * | https://lumi-supercomputer.github.io/update-202409/            |
   |                                                                |
*  | NOTE: The default version of both the Cray PE and LUMI stack   |
   | is now 24.03 and this is also the only version of the Cray PE  |
  *| officially supported on the current system. We recommend       |
   | moving to 24.03 when possible. Base libraries for 24.03 and    |
  *| 23.12 are already on the system and much user-installable      |
   | software for 24.03 is already available also.                  |
*  |                                                                |
   | Unfortunately, due to the late decision to move directly to    |
*  | ROCm 6.0 rather than the originally planned 5.7, we are not    |
  *| able to keep our promise of fully supporting 23.09 also. We    |
  *| did test many of the build recipes and tried to fix problems   |
   | when possible, but a recompile of GPU software will be needed. |
 * |                                                                |
   | Expect longer answer times as usual to very technical tickets  |
   | as there is still a lot of development work to do.             | 
 * |                                                                |
*  | You can use the lumi-workspaces command (without loading an    |
   | additional module) to check your quota and allocations on      |
   | LUMI. Also check `module help lumi-tools` for more info.       | 
*  .Notes-----------------------------------------------------------.
   | Make sure one of the following modules is loaded to have the   |
 * | full LUMI experience:                                          |
   | - CrayEnv: The Cray software stack enriched with some          |
   |   additional tools not installed by default in the OS          |
*  | - LUMI: The extensible LUMI software stack that you can use    |
   |   as a basis for additional software installs with EasyBuild   |
 * |   and other tools.                                             |
*  | - spack: If you are an experienced Spack user and know how it  |
   |   works. Spack is offered as-is. We do not do development or   |
  *|   bug fixing in Spack but do offer a configuration compatible  |
** |   with the Cray PE.                                            |
