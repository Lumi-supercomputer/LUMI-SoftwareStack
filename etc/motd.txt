 * | IMPORTANT: Check the post-maintenance updates on               |

   |                                                                |
*  | NOTE: The default version of both the Cray PE and LUMI stack   |
   | is now 25.03 and this is also the only version of the Cray PE  |
  *| officially supported on the current system. We recommend       |
   | moving to 25.03 when possible. This will also offer the        |
   | smoothest path for the next update.                            |
*  |                                                                |
NOTE: The default version of both the Cray PE and LUMI stack   |
is now 25.03, while 25.09 is also offered. We recommend moving
to 25.03 or 25.09 when possible. This will offer the smoothest
part for the next update.

NOTE: The default version of both the Cray PE and LUMI stack   |
We cannot guarantee that software installed before the 
January 2026 update will still run on the system. In some
cases, recompilation may help while in other cases moving to
software compiled with 25.03 or 25.09 is the only solution. 

A LUMI software stack based on 25.03 will appear on LUMI in
weeks after the update. A LUMI stack based on 25.09 will be
developed after that, as will new spack modules. Local 
software stacks (e.g., CSC modules and quantum computer
modules) will be developed by the organisations responsible
for these modules, and new containers with AI software will
be developed by the LUMI AI factory an no longer be offered 
by CSC.

   | You can use the lumi-workspaces command (without loading an    |
   | additional module) to check your quota and allocations on      |
  *| LUMI. Also check `module help lumi-tools` for more info.       | 
   |                                                                |
   | Note that LUMI users are responsible for verifying software    |
*  | licenses for the packages they use and must also obey to all   |
   | export restriction laws and other regulations imposed by the   |
   | EU, Finland, and USA. Countries from which LUMI is forbidden   |
 * | include Belarus, China, Iran and Russia, but this list is.     |
   | non-exhaustive and restrictions includes all countries under   |
   | EU or USA sanction affecting computer technology, including    |
   | hardware and software for AI.                                  |
*  .Notes-----------------------------------------------------------.
   | Make sure one of the following modules is loaded to have the   |
 * | full LUMI experience:                                          |
   | - CrayEnv: The Cray software stack enriched with some          |
   |   additional tools not installed by default in the OS          |
*  | - LUMI: The extensible LUMI software stack that you can use    |
   |   as a basis for additional software installs with EasyBuild   |
 * |   and other tools.                                             |
*  | - spack: If you are an experienced Spack user and know how it  |
   |   works. Spack is offered as-is. We do not do development or   |
  *|   bug fixing in Spack but do offer a configuration compatible  |
** |   with the Cray PE.                                            |
