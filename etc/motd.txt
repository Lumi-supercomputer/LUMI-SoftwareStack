*  | !!!Important as there are breaking changes!!! Please check     |
   | https://lumi-supercomputer.github.io/update-202311             |
 * | for changes to the configuration after the October-November    |
   | 2023 update. Note also that there are known problems with      |
 * | PrgEnv-cray and cray-mpich, see the notes linked above.        |
   |                                                                |
 * | NOTE: The default version of the LUMI software stack is        |
   | LUMI/22.08 while the default version of the Cray PE after      |
*  | login and in CrayEnv is 23.09. Please move as soon as possible |
   | from LUMI/22.08 to newer versions as 22.08 is not fully        |
 * | functional anymore. In the next few weeks base libraries for   |
   | 23.09 will be prepared and installed.                          |
  *|                                                                |
*  | You can use the lumi-workspaces command (without loading an    |
   | additional module) to check your quota and allocations on      |
   | LUMI. Also check `module help lumi-tools` for more info.       | 
*  .Notes-----------------------------------------------------------.
   | Make sure one of the following modules is loaded to have the   |
 * | full LUMI experience:                                          |
   | - CrayEnv: The Cray software stack enriched with some          |
   |   additional tools not installed by default in the OS          |
*  | - LUMI: The extensible LUMI software stack that you can use    |
   |   as a basis for additional software installs with EasyBuild   |
 * |   and other tools.                                             |
*  | - spack: If you are an experienced Spack user and know how it  |
   |   works. Spack is offered as-is. We do not do development or   |
  *|   bug fixing in Spack but do offer a configuration compatible  |
** |   with the Cray PE.                                            |
