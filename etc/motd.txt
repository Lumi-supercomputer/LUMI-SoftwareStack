 * | IMPORTANT: Check the post-maintenance updates on               |
 * | https://lumi-supercomputer.github.io/update-202409/            |
   |                                                                |
 * | NOTE: The default version of the LUMI software stack is        |
   | LUMI/23.09 while the default version of the Cray PE after      |
*  | login and in CrayEnv is 24.03. Please move as soon as possible |
   | from LUMI/23.09 or earlier to (preferably) 24.03 as older      |
  *| versions are not fully supported. In the next few weeks, base  |
   | libraries for 23.12 and 24.03 will be prepared and installed.  |
 * | The update has more impact than expected as when we advised    |
   | to switch to 23.09, the plan was to install ROCm 5.7 on the    |
*  | system, but as HPE completed ROCm 6 support in time for the    |
*  | system update, ROCm 6.0.3 was installed. The downside of this  |
   | is that it is only fully supported in the 24.03 programming    |
  *| environment, so that contrary to our expectations, we cannot   |
   | fully support 23.09 either.                                    |
 * |                                                                |
   | As several people of the LUST are busy preparing an updated    |
 * | software stack as that may be the only solution to several of  |
  *| user's issues, support response times to software problems     |
   | will be longer than usual.                                     | 
 * |                                                                |
*  | You can use the lumi-workspaces command (without loading an    |
   | additional module) to check your quota and allocations on      |
   | LUMI. Also check `module help lumi-tools` for more info.       | 
*  .Notes-----------------------------------------------------------.
   | Make sure one of the following modules is loaded to have the   |
 * | full LUMI experience:                                          |
   | - CrayEnv: The Cray software stack enriched with some          |
   |   additional tools not installed by default in the OS          |
*  | - LUMI: The extensible LUMI software stack that you can use    |
   |   as a basis for additional software installs with EasyBuild   |
 * |   and other tools.                                             |
*  | - spack: If you are an experienced Spack user and know how it  |
   |   works. Spack is offered as-is. We do not do development or   |
  *|   bug fixing in Spack but do offer a configuration compatible  |
** |   with the Cray PE.                                            |
