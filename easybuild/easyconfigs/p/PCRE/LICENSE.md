# PCRE License Information

PCRE and PCRE2 use a 3-Clause BSD License.

PCRE is barely maintained and users are encouraged to switch to PCRE2.
The precise license formulation for PCRE can be found in the LICENSE file in the source code.
See, e.g, also the
[LICENCE file in this unofficial mirror of the PCRE library](https://github.com/jwilk-mirrors/pcre/blob/trunk/LICENCE).
