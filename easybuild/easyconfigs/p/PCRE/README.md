# PCRE

Note that PCRE is old code that is no longer maintained. We're trying to move
over to the newer PCRE2 libraries which are the successor of PCRE.

  * [PCRE home page](http://www.pcre.org/)

  * [PCRE downloads](https://ftp.pcre.org/pub/pcre/)

  * [Alternative PCRE download on SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/pcre/files/pcre/) 
    (as the previous one seems to be dead as PCRE is no longer maintained)


## EasyBuild

  * [PCRE in the EasyBuilders repository](https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyconfigs/tree/develop/easybuild/easyconfigs/p/PCRE)

  * [PCRE in the CSCS repository](https://github.com/eth-cscs/production/tree/master/easybuild/easyconfigs/p/PCRE)


### Version 8.45 from CPE 21.06 on

  * The EasyConfig is derived from the University of Antwerpen one as that one builds
    a more fully featured version of the library.
