From `LUMI/24.03` onwards, this module is the new home for many Perl packages
that we used to provide in the [Perl](../Perl/index.md) module.

This is done to speed up the development and installation of a new central software
stack after a system update, as Perl is in the critical path and having to 
build a full configuration slows down the development and deployment tremenduously.
