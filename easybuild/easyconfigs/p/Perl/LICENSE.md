# Perl License Information

Perl licensing is a mess due to the large number of packages in a typical 
Perl installation that may each have their own license.

Perl itself is Open Source software, licensed under its 
[Artistic License](https://dev.perl.org/licenses/artistic.html), or the 
[GNU General Public License (GPL)](https://dev.perl.org/licenses/gpl1.html).
See also the
["Perl Licensing" page on the Perl web site](https://dev.perl.org/licenses/).

Perl packages included in the modules of the central software stack on LUMI
are all taken from [CPAN](https://www.cpan.org/). However, each package may
have its own license and it is impossible to name them all, so in
principle you have to check before using a Perl package.
