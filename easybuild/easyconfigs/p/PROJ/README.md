## EasyBuild

  * [PROJ support in the EasyBuilders repository](https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyconfigs/tree/develop/easybuild/easyconfigs/p/PROJ)

  * [PROJ support in the CSCS repository](https://github.com/eth-cscs/production/tree/master/easybuild/easyconfigs/p/PROJ)


### Version 8.1.1 from 21.08 on

  * The EasyConfig file is a mix of the EasyBuilders and CSCS one. Specifically,
    an additional dependency (cURL) was taken from the EasyBuilders one.

  * The documentation was enhanced.

  * No version for cpeAMD as the indirect Tcl dependency does not compile with that
    compiler.

  * PROJ does contain a number of commands also but no easy way to test them like
    producing help or a version without producing an error code.


### Version 9.0.0 from CPE 22.06 on

  * Started from a version bump of the 8.1.1 EasyConfig but had to switch to a
    `CMakeMake` build process.

  * The new EasyBuilders EasyConfig also includes `nlohmann_json` as a dependency
    which we do not yet have.


### Version 9.1.1 from 22.12 on

  * Version bump of the 9.0.0 EasyConfig


### Version 9.2.0 from 23.09 on

  * Version bump of the 9.2.0 EasyConfig
  
  * Needed to add an option to avoid generating errors on unused arguments as somehow 
    some ROCm libraries get added that are not needed.

  * For LUMI/23.12, license information was added to the installation, and the 
    installation of the libraries is done in `lib` rather than `lib64`. Moreover,
    `nlohmann-json` was added as a dependency to enable using an external one,
    and `googletest` was added to the build dependencies as it turned out it was
    auto-downloaded otherwise during the build.
    
    Note that contrary to what is done in the EasyBuilders repository, we made
    `nlohmann-json` a build dependency as it is only some header files and no
    library or other stuff that is needed when running.
