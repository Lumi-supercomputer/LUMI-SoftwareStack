# Vampir license information

The use of Vampir on LUMI is coverd by the Vampir Professional license
(see https://vampir.eu/licensing) which allows all LUMI users to use 
Vampir in both client and client-server mode also (see also the VampirServer module
for the server side).

However, the license only allows to run the client and server on LUMI, or the client
on CSC-owned machines. Even though Vampir can run the GUI on a local machine and let
that local machine then connect to a server on LUMI, that use case is not currently
supported by the license.

The license offers maintenance until 31 December 2026.
