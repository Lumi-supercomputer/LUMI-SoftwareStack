# rccl license information

The RCCL license is not a standard license since the package also contains code
from NVIDIA. All relevant information can be found in the
[LICENSES.txt](https://github.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/rccl/blob/develop/LICENSE.txt) and
[NOTICES.txt](https://github.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/rccl/blob/develop/NOTICES.txt)
files in the GitHub repository.
