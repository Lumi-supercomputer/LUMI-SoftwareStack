# ROCm user instructions

There is a **big disclaimer** with these modules.
The ROCm installation outside of the Cray PE modules 
(so the 5.1.4, 5.2.5 and 5.3.3 modules) 
come **without any warranty nor support** as they are not
installed in the proper directories suggested by AMD thus may break links
encoded in the RPMs from which these packages are installed and 
as they are are also
not guaranteed to be compatible with other modules from the Cray PE
as only HPE Cray can give that warranty.
