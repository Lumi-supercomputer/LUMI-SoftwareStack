## Easybuild

### ROCm 4.5.2

The EasyConfig unpack the official RPMs and copy them to the installation 
directory. This is a temporary setup so that the user that have access to the 
Early Access Platform can compile their code from the login node.

### ROCm 5.2.5 and 5.3.3

Unpacked form RPMs like previous version but use an EasyBlock to easy the 
process of EasyConfigs creation
