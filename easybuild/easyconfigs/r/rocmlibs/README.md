### rocmlibs 4.5.2

Bundle of the ROCm numerical libraries. Created for usage on the Early Access 
Platform. The bundle contains:

* [rocFFT](https://github.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/rocFFT): a software library for computing Fast Fourier Transforms
* [rocPRIM](https://github.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/rocPRIM): a header-only library providing HIP parallel primitives
* [rocRAND](https://github.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/rocRAND): pseudo-random and quasi-random numbers generator
* [rocBLAS](https://github.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/rocBLAS): Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms for AMD GPUs
* [rocSOLVER](https://github.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/rocSOLVER): subset of LAPACK functionality for AMD GPUs
* [rocSPARSE](https://github.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/rocSPARSE): Basic Linear Algebra Subroutines for sparse computation
* [rocALUTION](https://github.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/rocALUTION): a sparse linear algebra library
* [hipFFT](https://github.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/hipFFT): marshalling library supporting rocFFT or cuFFT as backends
* [hipBLAS](https://github.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/hipBLAS): marshalling library supporting rocBLAS or cuBLAS as backends
