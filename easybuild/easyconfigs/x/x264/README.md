# x264

The distribution of this code is a mess with a GitLab repository without tags and unclear
versions on the home page so we simply follow the state in EasyBuild.

## EasyBuild

  * [x264 support in the EasyBuilders repository](https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyconfigs/tree/develop/easybuild/easyconfigs/x/x264)

### Version 20210414 for CPE 21.06

  * The EasyConfig is derived from the EasyBuilders one with some elements taken
    from the University of Antwerpen one.


### Version 20230226 from CPE 22.12 on
    
  * Trivial port of the EasyConfig for 20210414, but with a change to the location
    where we copy the licensing information.
