### Version 5.2.5 from CPE 21.06 on

  * Standard EasyConfig derived from the EasyBuilders one but with additional
    documentation taken from the University of Antwerpen EasyConfig files.

    
### Version 5.4.2 from CPE 22.12 on

  * Trivial version bump of the 5.2.5 EasyConfig with removal of the patch as
    we assume the bug will be fixed by now.

  * For LUMI/23.12, license information was added to the installation.


### Version 5.4.4 for LUMI/24.03

  * Trivial version bump of the EasyConfig for 5.4.2 in LUMI/23.12.

  * gettext seems to be a build dependency only, so moved it.
