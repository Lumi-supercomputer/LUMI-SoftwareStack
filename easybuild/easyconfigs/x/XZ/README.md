### Version 5.2.5 from CPE 21.06 on

-   Standard EasyConfig derived from the EasyBuilders one but with additional
    documentation taken from the University of Antwerpen EasyConfig files.

    
### Version 5.4.2 from CPE 22.12 on

-   Trivial version bump of the 5.2.5 EasyConfig with removal of the patch as
    we assume the bug will be fixed by now.

-   For LUMI/23.12, license information was added to the installation.


### Version 5.4.4 for LUMI/24.03

-   Trivial version bump of the EasyConfig for 5.4.2 in LUMI/23.12.

-   gettext seems to be a build dependency only, so moved it.
 

### Version 5.6.3 for LUMI/25.03

-   Trivial version bump of the EasyConfig for 5.4.4 in LUMI/24.03.


### Version 5.8.1 for LUMI/25.09
