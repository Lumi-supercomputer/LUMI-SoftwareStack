### Version 5.2.5 from CPE 21.06 on

  * Standard EasyConfig derived from the EasyBuilders one but with additional
    documentation taken from the University of Antwerpen EasyConfig files.

    
### Version 5.4.2 from CPE 22.12 on

  * Trivial version bump of the 5.2.5 EasyConfig with removal of the patch as
    we assume the bug will be fixed by now.

    
### Version 5.4.6 from CPE 23.12 on

  * Started from the 5.4.2 EasyConfig.
  
  * Added more sanity checks.
  
  * Added license information to the installation directories.
