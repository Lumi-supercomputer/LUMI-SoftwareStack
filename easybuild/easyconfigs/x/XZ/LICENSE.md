# XZ license information

XZ Utils licensing is somewhat complicated as different components have different
licenses. See the
[COPYING file in the source distribution](https://git.tukaani.org/?p=xz.git;a=blob_plain;f=COPYING;hb=HEAD).

From LUMI/23.12 on, this file and various files that it refers to, can also be found 
in the `$EBROOTXZ/share/licenses/XZ` subdirectory after loading the module.
