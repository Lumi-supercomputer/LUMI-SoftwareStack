# XZ license information

XZ Utils licensing is somewhat complicated as different components have different
licenses. See the
[COPYING file in the source distribution](https://git.tukaani.org/?p=xz.git;a=blob_plain;f=COPYING;hb=HEAD).

From version 5.4.6 on, the license information can also be found in
`$EBROOTX/share/licenses/XZ` after loading the `XZ` module.
