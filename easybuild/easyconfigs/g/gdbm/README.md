### Version 1.20 from CPE 21.06 on

-   The EasyConfig is derived from the University of Antwerpen one as that one
    is more complete in terms of dependencies.


### Version 1.23 from CPE 22.06 on

-   Trivial version bump of the EasyConfig, but we removed unnecessary variables
    from the EasyConfig accidentally left in when copying from the UAntwerpen
    repository.

-   For LUMI/23.12, license information was added to the installation.


### Version 1.25 for 25.03

-   The EasyConfig is a trivial port of the 1.23 EasyConfig for 24.03/24.11.
