### gettext 0.21 from 21.06 on

  * This repository provides 2 configurations of gettext

      * The ``-minimal`` configuration is compiled with a minimum of external dependencies.
        i.e., only ncurses

      * The regular configuration is more full-featured. It has however dependencies that
        themselves use gettext during the build process so we had to provide a more
        minimalistic version to work around circular dependencies.

    This aspect is different from the EasyConfigs in the Easybuilders and CSCS repositories.
    These repositories provide an in-between version that uses a libxml2 produced with
    EasyBuild rather than the internal one used in the ``-minimal`` configuration and
    hence also uses zlib.
