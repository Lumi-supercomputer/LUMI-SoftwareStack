### 2.69.1 for CPE 21.06

-   Started from a mix of the EasyBuilders and University of Antwerpen
    EasyConfig files

-   An additional dependency was needed: libiconv.

-   NOTE 2021-12-06: Replaced PCRE2 dependency with PCRE dependency as it turned out
    that GLib downloaded PCRE during the installation process.


### Version 2.73.0 from CPE 22.06 on

-   Trivial version bump of the 2.69.1 one.


### Version 2.75.0 from CPE 22.12 on

-   Almost trivial version bump of the 2.73.0 one, 
  
    -   but switched from PCRE to PCRE2
      
    -   and trying the new fix_python_shebang_for option.


### Version 2.77.1 from CPE 23.03 on

-   Trivial version bump of the 2.75.0 one.

-   But it looks like the iconv flag is no longer supported, so remove this.
  
-   **Note:** Even though GLib itself installs fine with Clang 16 (in cpe 23.03), it looks like
    using its header files causes problems reporting type cast errors that 
    seem impossible to turn off.
    
-   Building with cpeGNU using the compiler wrappers didn't work anymore. 
    It appears something in the options processing
    has changed (the C compiler is different), and the build fails when processing `gio/tests/test5.gresource`.
    The build procedure complains that it cannot find certain standard system libraries 
    that are certainly there. The command line generated by the build process does add a 
    `-nostdlib` to avoid trying to include those libraries, but the CPE compiler wrapper
    then adds them again.
    
    The solution for now was to force meson to not use the wrappers.


### Version 2.78.1 for LUMI/24.03 and LUMI/24.11

-   Trivial port of the EasyConfig for 2.77.1 in LUMI/23.12.


### Version 2.85.1 for LUMI/25.03

-   Trivial port of the EasyConfig for 2.78.1 in 24.03/24.11.

-   But then we made several refinements to the way options are specified, etc., and 
    added a lot of sanity checks so that we will note changes to the package in the
    future.

-   Instead of the EasyBuild shebang solution, we encode the full path to Cray Python so that
    even if the `cray-ptyhon` module would not be loaded, the right Python executable would
    be used.
