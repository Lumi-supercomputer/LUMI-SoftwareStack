# gnuplot license information

The gnuplot licensing seems to be a bit of a mess due to a complicated history.
Different components may be covered by different licenses because of this.

There is a [copyright notice in the git repository](https://sourceforge.net/p/gnuplot/gnuplot-main/ci/master/tree/).

From LUMI/23.12 on, the `Copyright` file can also be found in the directory
`$EBROOTGNUPLOT/share/licenses/gnuplot' after loading the module.
