# gc license information

The license information is available on the 
[license page of the gc web site](https://hboehm.info/gc/license.txt).

The module also uses "libatomic_ops".  Its license information can be found 
in the [LICENSE file of the libatomic_ops GitHub](https://github.com/ivmai/libatomic_ops/blob/master/LICENSE).

From LUMI/23.12 on, most license information can also be found in
`$EBROOTGC/share/licenses` after loading the `gc` module.
