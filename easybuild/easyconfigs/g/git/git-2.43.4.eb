description = """
Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed
to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

Git is easy to learn and has a tiny footprint with lightning fast performance.
It outclasses SCM tools like Subversion, CVS, Perforce, and ClearCase with
features like cheap local branching, convenient staging areas, and multiple
workflows.

Note that git in this module comes without manpages due to difficulties in
generating those pages in the software management frameworks typically used on
HPC systems. Any manual page you may see for git is for a system-installed version
of git and not necessarily for this module.
