## General instructions

-   [Ogg](https://www.xiph.org/ogg/) is an optional but highly recommended dependency.

-   [XMMS](http://www.xmms.org/) is an optional dependency that we did not include
    given that it is of little use on a cluster.

## EasyConfig

-   There is no support for FLAC in the CSCS repository
