# FreeType license info

FreeType comes with two licenses from which you can choose the one which fits your needs best.

-   The [FreeType License (FTL)](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/freetype/freetype/-/blob/master/docs/FTL.TXT) 
    is the most commonly used one. It is a BSD-style license with a credit clause 
    and thus compatible with the GNU Public License (GPL) version 3, 
    but not with the GPL version 2.

-   The [GNU General Public License (GPL), version 2](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/freetype/freetype/-/blob/master/docs/GPLv2.TXT). 
    Use it for all projects which use the GPLv2 also, or which need a license 
    compatible to the GPLv2.

This information can be found on the 
["FreeType licenses" page](https://freetype.org/license.html)

From LUMI/23.12 on, all license information can also be found in the
`$EBROOTFREETYPE/share/licenses/freetype` subdirectory after loading the module.
