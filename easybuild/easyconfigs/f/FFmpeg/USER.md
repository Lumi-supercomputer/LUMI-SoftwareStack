## What is FFmpeg?

[FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) 
is a leading multimedia framework, able to decode, encode, transcode,
mux, demux, stream, filter and play pretty much anything that humans and
machines have created. It supports the most obscure ancient formats up to the
cutting edge. No matter if they were designed by some standards committee, the
community or a corporation. It is also highly portable: FFmpeg compiles, runs,
and passes our testing infrastructure FATE across Linux, Mac OS X, Microsoft
Windows, the BSDs, Solaris, etc. under a wide variety of build environments,
machine architectures, and configurations.

It contains libavcodec, libavutil, libavformat, libavfilter, libavdevice,
libswscale and libswresample which can be used by applications. As well as
ffmpeg, ffplay and ffprobe which can be used by end users for transcoding
and playing.

The FFmpeg project tries to provide the best technically possible solution
for developers of applications and end users alike. To achieve this the project combines
the best free software options available. It slightly favours its own code to keep
the dependencies on other libs low and to maximize code sharing between parts of
FFmpeg. Wherever the question of "best" cannot be answered it supports both
options so the end user can choose.

There is [web-based documentation for FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/documentation.html).
