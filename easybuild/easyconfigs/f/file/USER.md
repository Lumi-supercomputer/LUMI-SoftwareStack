## What is file?

The [file command](https://www.darwinsys.com/file/) 
is 'a file type guesser', that is, a command-line tool
that tells you in words what kind of data a file contains. Unlike most
GUI systems, command-line UNIX systems - with this program leading the
charge - don't rely on filename extentions to tell you the type of a file,
but look at the file's actual contents. This is, of course, more reliable,
but requires a bit of I/O.

The module does not only provide the file command, but also libmagic on
which it is based.
