# DB User Instructions

## What is DB?

[Oracle Berkeley DB](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/related/berkeleydb.html) 
is a family of embedded key-value database libraries providing
scalable high-performance data management services to applications. The
Berkeley DB products use simple function-call APIs for data access and
management.

Berkeley DB enables the development of custom data management solutions,
without the overhead traditionally associated with such custom projects.
Berkeley DB provides a collection of well-proven building-block technologies
that can be configured to address any application need from the hand-held
device to the data center, from a local storage solution to a world-wide
distributed one, from kilobytes to petabytes.
