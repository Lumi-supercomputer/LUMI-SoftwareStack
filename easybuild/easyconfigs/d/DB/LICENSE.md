# DB license

Oracle employs a dual licensing model that offers customers a choice 
of either our open source license or a commercial license. Our open 
source license is OSI-certified and permits use of Berkeley DB in 
open source projects or in applications that are not distributed to 
third parties.

Our commercial license permits closed-source distribution of an 
application to third parties and provides business assurance. 
Please address your request for commercial licensing to 
berkeleydb-info_us@oracle.com.

The [full licensing information can be found on the Oracle Berkeley DB licensing page](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/related/berkeleydb/berkeleydb-licensing.html).
