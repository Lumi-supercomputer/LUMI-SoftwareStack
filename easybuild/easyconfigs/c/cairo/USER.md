# cairo user instructions

## What is cairo?

Cairo is a 2D graphics library with support for multiple output devices. 
The library supports a range of output targets, including the X Window System 
(via both Xlib and XCB), image buffers, PostScript, PDF, and SVG file output.
However, not all of them are currently supported on LUMI by these modules.
E.g., Qt is missing and so are various OpenGL-based targets.
