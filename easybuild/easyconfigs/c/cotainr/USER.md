# cotainr user documentation.

Extensive user documentation for cotainr is available on
[ReadTheDocs](https://cotainr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

The cotainr package is developed by the LUMI consortium member DeiC (Denmark).

Several modules are available on LUMI, depending on the environment that you're
using:

-   In `CrayEnv` the `cotainr` modules will use whatever version of `cray-python`
    is the default.
-   In `LUMI` software stacks the version of `cray-python` that matches the 
    version of the software stack will be used. This is also reflected in the 
    version part of the name of the module.
