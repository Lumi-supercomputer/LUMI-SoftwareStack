description = """"
cotainr is a tool that helps making Singularity/Apptainer containers.
It runs entirely in user space, i.e. you donâ€™t need root/sudo priviledges 
(or fake them) to use cotainr. It makes it a lot easier to build 
Singularity/Apptainer containers for certain HPC use cases.

In order to achieve this, the scope of cotainr is deliberately limited - focus 
is on making it easy to build reasonably performant containers for common HPC 
use cases. If you need a general purpose solution for building containers that 
achieve the absolute maximum performance, you should stick with 
Apptainer/Singularity instead of cotainr.

The software is provided by LUMI consortium partner DeiC.

Note that this software requires a more recent Python then the system Python
provided by the SUSE OS on LUMI. This module will load whatever version of
cray-python is the default when the module is loaded.
