The oneTBB package is often also just known as TBB or tbb.

-   There is no support in the CSCS repository.

### Version 2021.13.0 for cpeGNU/24.03

-   The EasyConfig is derived from the JSC one.
    

### Version 2022.2.0 for cpeGNU/25.03

-   We would have preferred to stay with the older 2021.13.0 version, but that version
    gave issues with gcc 14.2.
    
-   The upgrade is otherwise a trivial upgrade of the 2021.13.0 EasyConfig for 24.03.
