# Arm Forge instructions

The naming of this easyconfig doesn't completely follow the regular EasyBuild conventions 
(it would then have to be Arm-Forge given the way it is mostly spelled in the Arm documentation)
but we decided to follow the name chosen at JSC.

-   [Arm Forge home page](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/Arm%20Forge)


## EasyBuild

-   There is [a software easyblock for Allinea](https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyblocks/blob/develop/easybuild/easyblocks/a/allinea.py) 
    that is usable.
    
-   There is [support for Arm Forge in the JSC repository](https://github.com/easybuilders/JSC/tree/2022/Golden_Repo/a/ARMForge)


### 22.0.1 for the system partition

-   Build from the JSC one, with updated documentation.
