## EasyBuild

  * [util-linux support in the EasyBuilders repository](https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyconfigs/tree/develop/easybuild/easyconfigs/u/util-linux)

  * [util-linux support in the CSCS repository](https://github.com/eth-cscs/production/tree/master/easybuild/easyconfigs/u/util-linux)


### 2.37.1 from cpe 21.06 on

  * The EasyConfig is derived from a mix of the EasyConfigs of the EasyBuilders repository,
    CSCS and University of Antwerpen, the latter for the documentation.

  * The list of dependencies was revised: added file for libmagic.

  * The configure options were also checked and extended.

  * We need to use ``--without-tinfo`` as otherwise we get an error message about
    ``cur_term`` not found.


### 2.38 from CPE 22.06 on

  * Trivial version bump of the EasyConfig,


### 2.38.1 from CPE 22.12 on

  * Trivial version bump of the EasyConfig of 2.38.

  * For LUMI/23.12, license information was added to the installation.


### **NO** 2.39 from CPE 23.09 on

  * Port of the 2.38.1 EasyConfig but with the patches of the EasyBuild version added.
  
  * Did not work so reverted to 2.38.1.


### Version 2.39.3 from LUMI/24.03 on

  * Version bump of 2.38.1 for LUMI/23.12
  
  * The bugs that hit us in 2.39 seem to be fixed without any patches that have since 
    been developed by the EasyBuild community, so we deviate from 2023b.


### Version 2.39.3 from LUMI/24.03 on

  * Version bump of 2.39.3 for LUMI/24.02 and 24.11,
  
  * but there is a new dependency: SQLite, for a function that is enabled by default.
  
  * And there is also an extra configure flag `--disable-symvers` needed for cpeCray 
    as there are issues with versioned symbols.
