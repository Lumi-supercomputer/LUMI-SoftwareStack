### Version 2.1.1. from CPE 21.06 on

  * Our EasyConfig is derived from the standard EasyBuilders files.

  * For LUMI/23.12, license information was added to the installation.

  * For the version for LUMI/25.03, we corrected the download URL as that has changed.
    Back-ported to 24.03 and 24.11 to ensure that if these would be reinstalled, the
    sources are still found.
