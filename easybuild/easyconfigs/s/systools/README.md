system.

### Bundle version 15.1.0 for SUSE Linux 15SP1

-   When compiling htop with unicode enable it causes a segmentation violation
    (but not with -h or --version so it is not detected in the EasyBuild sanity
    check). The likely cause is a problem with out ncursesw library that is part
    of syslibs and fully static.
    

### 21.12


### 22.06 and 22.08

-   Update of htop and some improvements to the EasyConfig.

-   Robustified the installation on LUMI with checksums.


### 22.12 and 23.03

-   Version bumps for GPP/htop/tree.

-   Adding libtree

-   Changing the layout of the EasyConfig a bit, also adding license information.


### 23.03

-   Version bumps for GPP/htop/tree.


### 23.09

-   Version bumps for GPP/htop/tree.

-   In a revised edition we also provided the proot command for use with singularity.

    -   We went for build that is fully static except for libc taken from the system to
        be as independent from anything else as possible. The procedure in the EasyConfig
        is a LUST development.
        
    -   Needed to fix the Makefile as the warnings about it not being a git repository
        caused EasyBuild to stop the build.


### 23.12 and 24.03

-   Version bump of `htop`, but otherwise similar as the 23.09 one with the `proot` 
    command.
    
-   Did have to change the download location for the `tree` command though which also 
    led to a slightly different build process.


### 24.03-1 and 24.11
 
-   Added `pbzip2` to the bundle:

    -   The only dependency is libbz2, and we use a static version of it from the systools module.

    -   This part of the EasyConfig is heavily inspired on the EasyBuilders one for 
        PBZIP2.

    -   We developed a small patch to detect the number of cores available via the `sched_getaffinity` 
        function so that it works as expected in a Slurm job, and also limit the default number of 
        threads to 16 on the login nodes.


### 25.03

-   Identical to the 24.11 version
