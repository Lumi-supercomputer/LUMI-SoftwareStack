-   Trivial port of the EasyConfig

Build problem with cpeGNU when using the 12.2.0 compilers:

-   The .so files build correctly and take the runtime libraries from GCC 12.

-   The regular binaries however take the ones in /opt/cray/pe/gcc-libs/ instead
    which on LUMI are currently the ones from GCC 11
    

### 73.2 from CPE 23.09

-   Trivial port of the 72.1 EasyConfig.

-   For LUMI/23.12, license information was added to the installation.
