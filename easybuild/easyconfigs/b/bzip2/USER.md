## What is bzip2?

Bzip2 is a freely available, patent free, high-quality data compressor. It
typically compresses files to within 10% to 15% of the best available techniques
(the PPM family of statistical compressors), whilst being around twice as fast
at compression and six times faster at decompression. It is based on the
Burrows-Wheeler block-sorting text compression algorithm and Huffman coding.
