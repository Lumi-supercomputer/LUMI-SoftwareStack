## EasyConfigs

### 22.12 and 23.03 and 23.09 and 23.12 and 24.03

-   Initial version directly derived from buildtools/22.08, leaving out all the
    components that are already in buildtools/22.12 or 23.03.


### 23.09-cray-python3.10

-   Newer versions of Meson, but needs cray-python to run.


### 23.12-cray-python3.11

-   Stuck to the same versions of Meson and SCons as for 23.09 to minimize problems.
