      * [Releases](https://gitlab.com/libeigen/eigen/-/releases)


## General information

  * Eigen is just a template library for C++. Hence the installation is completelhy compiler-neutral.

  * Eigen moved to GitLab at the end of 2019, so old EasyConfig files will no longer
    succeed in downloading the files from BitBucket. The move was made because BitBucket
    dit no longer support mercurial, and if the had to switch to git, they decided
    they could as well switch to another provider.

  * According to [the installation instructions](https://gitlab.com/libeigen/eigen/-/blob/master/INSTALL)

      * One can simply copy the `Eigen` subdirectory to any desired location.

      * There is also a CMake installation process. It does install some additional
        files such as support for pkgconfig and for CMake. *That CMake process can
        produce a lot of warnings, but they are really only relevant to those installing
        Eigen during the compilation process for an actual application, and not to
        simply do a source install of Eigen.*


## EasyBuild

  * [support for Eigen in the EasyBuilders repository](https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyconfigs/tree/develop/easybuild/easyconfigs/e/Eigen).
    The procedure might be more complicated then needed as a custom EasyBlock is used which
    given the simplicity of the installation process seems overkill.

  * [Eigen support in the CSCS repository](https://github.com/eth-cscs/production/tree/master/easybuild/easyconfigs/e/Eigen)


### Version 3.3.9 for LUMI/21.08 and LUMI/21.12

  * As this is just a template library it does not make sense to install this
    for a specific toolchain or specific partition. We recommend to simply use the
    SYSTEM toolchain and to install in the common virtual partition.

    The installation process does do a lot of checks but it seems that they are only
    to compile a number of test programs and don't do anything to the Eigen
    configuration itself.

  * Use downloads from GitLab.

  * Installed using the system toolchain as there is nothing compiler-specific
    about the whole package.

  * Note that 3.4.0 was out at the time that we made the EasyConfig file, but that
    one did not install properly. During the installation process an illegal directory
    name was generated. It is not clear if this is a problem with the EasyBlock or with
    the Eigen installation process itself.



### Version 3.4 for LUMI/22.06 and LUMI/22.08

  * Trivial port of the 3.3.9 EasyConfig.


### 3.4.0 for 21.12/23.03

  * Looks like the Eigen people returned to a normal version numberins, so adapted the
    EasyConfig.
