# ESMF user instructions

For toolchains after 24.03 or versions after 8.6.0, ESMF will no longer be
part of the pre-installed modules as the development time for the recipes is
too high and as it turns out that we need too many different build types to 
keep all users happy. Some model recipes will remain available as 
user-installable modules.
