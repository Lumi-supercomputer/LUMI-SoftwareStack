## What is expat?

[Expat](https://libexpat.github.io/) 
is an XML parser library written in C. It is a stream-oriented parser in
which an application registers handlers for things the parser might find in the
XML document (like start tags).

[Web-based documentation is available](https://libexpat.github.io/doc/).
