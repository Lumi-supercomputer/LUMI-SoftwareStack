description = """
Expat is an XML parser library written in C. It is a stream-oriented parser in
which an application registers handlers for things the parser might find in the
XML document (like start tags).

The module contains the command line tool xmlwf and static and shared libraries.
"""

usage = """
The command line utility xmlwf checks whether a XML document is well-formed.
Help for this command is available through a man page.

The library is documented on the expat web page.
