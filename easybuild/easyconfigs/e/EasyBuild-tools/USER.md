# EasyBuild-tools user information

The `EasyBuild-tools` module contains a number of tools that are missing from the OS 
installation on LUMI, but are needed by some EasyConfigs as basic tools that EasyBuild
expects to find in the OS (hence may be run without even first loading the build
dependencies).

The version numbering of the modules corresponds to the version number of the LUMI 
stack for which they were meant.

From LUMI/24.11, a different solution was used, trying to integrate the tools as
much as possible in the EasyBuild module itself.
