# Build plan

**THIS DOCUMENT IS UNDER CONTINUOUS DEVELOPMENT**

The table below gives an impression of the dependencies between packages.

Packages in block X only depend on packages in blocks X-1 or lower and can all
be build together.

## Block -1

The following EasyBuild packages are replaced by OS dependencies:

  * pkg-config: It is mandatory to use the Cray version. It is used internally
    in the compiler wrappers, and loading an EasyBuild one causes failures in
    those wrappers.

  * OpenSSL to ensure that security patches are applied


## Block 0

  * [buildtools (SYSTEM in common)](b/buildtools)


## Block 1

### Common
 
  * [lumi-CPEtools (cpe*)](l/lumi-CPEtools): Requires buildtools

  * [syslibs (SYSTEM)](s/syslibs), requires buildtools

### Regular

  * [Eigen (SYSTEM in common)](e/Eigen) - Version of the template library installed without
    any dependencies in the module.

  * [xorg-macros (SYSTEM in common)](x/xorg-macros) - Needed for X11 and some of its dependencies

  * [Rust (SYSTEM in common)](r/Rust) - Needed for those users who want to install HyperQueue

  * [Blosc (cpe*)](b/Blosc) - meta-compression library

  * [ESMF (cpe*)](e/ESMF) - Tool for coupling climate models, only used in contributed
    packages but as it needs adaptations to an EasyBlock we put it here as a
