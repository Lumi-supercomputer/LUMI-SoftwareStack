description = """
PROJ is a generic coordinate transformation software that transforms geospatial
coordinates from one coordinate reference system (CRS) to another. This
includes cartographic projections as well as geodetic transformations. PROJ is
released under the X/MIT open source license

PROJ includes command line applications for easy conversion of coordinates from
text files or directly from user input. In addition to the command line
utilities PROJ also exposes an application programming interface, or API in
short. The API lets developers use the functionality of PROJ in their own
software without having to implement similar functionality themselves.

PROJ started purely as a cartography application letting users convert geodetic
coordinates into projected coordinates using a number of different cartographic
projections. Over the years, as the need has become apparent, support for datum
shifts has slowly worked its way into PROJ as well. Today PROJ supports more than
a hundred different map projections and can transform coordinates between datums
using all but the most obscure geodetic techniques.
