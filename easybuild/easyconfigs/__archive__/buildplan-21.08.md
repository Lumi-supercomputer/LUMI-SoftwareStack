# Build plan

**THIS DOCUMENT IS STILL VERY INCOMPLETE**

The table below gives an impression of the dependencies between packages.

Packages in block X only depend on packages in blocks X-1 or lower and can all
be build together.

## Block -1

The following EasyBuild packages are replaced by OS dependencies:

  * pkg-config: It is mandatory to use the Cray version. It is used internally
    in the compiler wrappers, and loading an EasyBuild one causes failures in
    those wrappers.

  * OpenSSL to ensure that security patches are applied


## Block 0

  * buildtools (SYSTEM in common)


## Block 1

  * Eigen (SYSTEM in common) - Version of the template library installed without
    any dependencies in the module.

  * xorg-macros (SYSTEM in common) - Needed for X11 and some of its dependencies

  * Rust (SYSTEM in common) - Needed for those users who want to install HyperQueue

  * Blosc (cpe*) - meta-compression library

  * Brotli (cpe*) - Lossless compression algorithm.

  * bzip2 (cpe*) - Popular compression library, dependency for PCRE2.

  * DB (cpe*) - Berkeley Database, used by a Perl package

  * double-conversion (cpe*) - Binary-decimal and decimal-binary conversions

  * ELPA (cpeGNU) - Large-scale eigenvalue solver

  * ESMF (cpe*) - Tool for coupling climate models, only used in contributed
    packages but as it needs adaptations to an EasyBlock we put it here as a
    courtasy to our users. Skip for now as it turns out to be a mistake in
    the EasyBuilders NCO EasyConfig. It is not linked into the package.

  * expat (cpe*) - XML parser and a popular dependency for many packages

  * FriBidi (cpe*) - Free Implementation of the Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm
