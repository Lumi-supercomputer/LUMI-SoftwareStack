Opus is a totally open, royalty-free, highly versatile audio codec. Opus is
unmatched for interactive speech and music transmission over the Internet,

standardized by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) as RFC 6716
which incorporated technology from Skype’s SILK codec and Xiph.Org’s
CELT codec.
