description = """
LZO is a portable lossless data compression library written in ANSI C.
It offers pretty fast compression and *extremely* fast decompression.
It also includes slower compression levels achieving a quite competitive
compression ratio while still decompressing at this very high speed.
It is faster than zlib or BZIP2, but doesn't compress as well as those
packages do.
