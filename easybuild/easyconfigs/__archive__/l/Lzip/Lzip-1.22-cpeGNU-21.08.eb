description = """
Lzip is a lossless data compressor with a user interface
similar to the one of gzip or bzip2. Lzip can compress about as fast as gzip
(lzip -0) or compress most files more than bzip2 (lzip -9). Decompression
speed is intermediate between gzip and bzip2. Lzip is better than gzip
and bzip2 from a data recovery perspective. Lzip has been designed,
written, and tested with great care to replace gzip and bzip2 as the
standard general-purpose compressed format for unix-like systems.
