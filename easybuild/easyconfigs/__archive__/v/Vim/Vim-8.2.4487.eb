description = """
Vim is a highly configurable text editor built to make creating and changing
any kind of text very efficient. It is included as "vi" with most UNIX systems
and with Apple OS X.

Vim is rock stable and is continuously being developed to become even better.
Among its features are:
  * persistent, multi-level undo tree
  * extensive plugin system
  * support for hundreds of programming languages and file formats
  * powerful search and replace
  * integrates with many tools

The module only provides a console version of vim, not a GUI version.
