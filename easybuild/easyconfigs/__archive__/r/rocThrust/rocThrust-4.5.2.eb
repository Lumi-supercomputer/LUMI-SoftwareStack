description = """
Thrust allows you to implement high performance parallel applications with
minimal programming effort through a high-level interface. rocThrust is the
HIP/ROCm implementation of Thrust

Thrust provides a rich collection of data parallel primitives such as scan,
sort, and reduce, which can be composed together to implement complex algorithms
with concise, readable source code. By describing your computation in terms of
these high-level abstractions you provide Thrust with the freedom to select the
most efficient implementation automatically. As a result, Thrust can be utilized
in rapid prototyping of HIP applications, where programmer productivity matters
most, as well as in production, where robustness and absolute performance are
crucial.
