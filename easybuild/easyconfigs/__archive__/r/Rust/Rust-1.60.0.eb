description = """
Rust is blazingly fast and memory-efficient: with no runtime or garbage collector,
it can power performance-critical services, run on embedded devices, and easily
integrate with other languages. Rust’s rich type system and ownership model
guarantee memory-safety and thread-safety — enabling you to eliminate many
classes of bugs at compile-time.

Note that the Rust installation process is not exactly HPC-friendly and 
downloads files on the fly, so installation will not work on nodes that do
not have internet access. Moreover, because of this we cannot give any
guarantee about reproducibility of the install or even our ability to 
re-install Rust when needed, so this version may disappear without any
warning.
