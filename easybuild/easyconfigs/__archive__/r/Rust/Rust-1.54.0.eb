Rust is blazingly fast and memory-efficient: with no runtime or garbage collector,
it can power performance-critical services, run on embedded devices, and easily
integrate with other languages. Rust’s rich type system and ownership model
guarantee memory-safety and thread-safety — enabling you to eliminate many
classes of bugs at compile-time.
