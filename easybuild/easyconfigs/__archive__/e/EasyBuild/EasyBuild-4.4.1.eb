EasyBuild is a software build and installation framework
written in Python that allows you to install software in a structured,
repeatable and robust way.
"""

usage = """
See the documentation on readthedocs. Only the documentation of the latest
version is readily available.

The EasyBuild module on LUMI should be used through the EasyBuild-user or
EasyBuild-production modules. These modules ensure that EasyBuild is properly
configured to install software on LUMI.
  * Installing software that is common to all partitions: First load the
    appropriate LUMI software stack module and the hidden partition/common module
    and then load either EasyBuild-user or EasyBuild-production (the latter for
    system managers only) module.
  * Installing software for a specific partition works in the same way, but then
    by loading the appropriate partition module. It is best to compile software on
    a node of that partition as cross-compiling may not always work as some packages
    have the nasty habit to add compiler options that conflict with the requirements
    of cross-compiling.
