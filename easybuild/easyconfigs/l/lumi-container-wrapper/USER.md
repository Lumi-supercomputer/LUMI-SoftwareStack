Documentation:

-   The [documentation in the LUMI documentation](https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/software/installing/container-wrapper/)
    is the first source of documentation as it is specifically for LUMI.

-   The [CSC Tykky documentation page](https://docs.csc.fi/computing/containers/tykky/)
    may also containe useful information, but not everything has been tested on LUMI.
