    -   [libpsl GitHub releases](https://github.com/rockdaboot/libpsl/releases)

## EasyBuild

-   [Support for libpsl in the EasyBuilders repository](https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyconfigs/tree/develop/easybuild/easyconfigs/l/libpsl)

-   There is no support for libpsl in the CSCS repository


### Version 0.21.1 for CPE 22.06

-   The EasyConfig is a port of the standard EasyBuilders one.

-   We did improve the sanity check however.


### Version 0.21.5 for CPE 23.12

-   Trivial port of the 0.21.1 one, but we now also copy the license information to 
    the installation directories and have improved the sanity checks.
