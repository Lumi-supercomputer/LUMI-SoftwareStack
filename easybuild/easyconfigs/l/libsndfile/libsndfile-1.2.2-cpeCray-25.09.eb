description = """
Libsndfile is a C library for reading and writing files containing sampled sound
(such as MS Windows WAV and the Apple/SGI AIFF format) through one standard
library interface. It is released in source code format under the Gnu Lesser
General Public License.

The library was written to compile and run on a Linux system but should compile
and run on just about any Unix (including MacOS X). There are also pre-compiled
binaries available for 32 and 64 bit windows.

It was designed to handle both little-endian (such as WAV) and big-endian (such
as AIFF) data, and to compile and run correctly on little-endian (such as Intel
and DEC/Compaq Alpha) processor systems as well as big-endian processor systems
such as Motorola 68k, Power PC, MIPS and Sparc. Hopefully the design of the
library will also make it easy to extend for reading and writing new sound file
formats.

This module includes support for the FLAC, Opus and OggVorbis codecs, but does
not include support for the obsoleet Speex codec. It also does not include support
for ALSA and SQLite.
