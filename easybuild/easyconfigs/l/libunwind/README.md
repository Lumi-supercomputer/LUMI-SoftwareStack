### Version 1.5.0 for CPE 21.08 and 21.12

  * The EasyConfig is derived from the EasyBuilders one


### Version 1.6.2 for CPE 22.06

  * Trivial version bump of the 1.5.0 EasyConfig, but edited a bit to make it more
    uniform.

    
### Version 1.8.0 from CPE 23.12 on

  * Switched to a download location on GitHub that contains way more recent versions.
  
  * Otherwise a port of the 1.6.2 EasyConfig with much improved sanity checks.
  
  * Added license information to the installation directories.
