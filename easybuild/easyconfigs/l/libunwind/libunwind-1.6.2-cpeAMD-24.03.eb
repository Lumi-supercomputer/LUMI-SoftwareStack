description = """
Libunwind is define a portable and efficient C programming interface (API) to
determine the call-chain of a program. The API additionally provides the means
to manipulate the preserved (callee-saved) state of each call-frame and to
resume execution at any point in the call-chain (non-local goto). The API
supports both local (same-process) and remote (across-process) operation. As
such, the API is useful in a number of applications

- exception handling: the libunwind API makes it trivial to implement the
  stack-manipulation aspects of exception handling.

- debuggers: the libunwind API makes it trivial for debuggers to generate the
  call-chain (backtrace) of the threads in a running program.

- introspection: it is often useful for a running thread to determine its
  call-chain. For example, this is useful to display error messages (to show how
  the error came about) and for performance monitoring/analysis.

- efficient setjmp(): With libunwind, it is possible to implement an extremely
  efficient version of setjmp(). Effectively, the only context that needs to be
  saved consists of the stack-pointer(s).
