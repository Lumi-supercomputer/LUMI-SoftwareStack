# lumio technical documentation.

This module is part of the modules that provide support for the LUMI-O
object storage system. This module contains the configuration script where
currently we expect that changes may be needed more often, while the
[lumio-ext-tools](../lumio-ext-tools) module provides some basic commands
that don't need frequent updates.
