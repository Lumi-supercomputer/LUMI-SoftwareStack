## EasyBuild

-   [libidn2 support in the EasyBuilders repository](https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyconfigs/tree/develop/easybuild/easyconfigs/l/libidn2)

-   There is no libidn2 support in the CSCS repository


### Version 2.3.2 from CPE 21.06 on

-   The EasyConfig is a mix of the EasyBuilders and University of Antwerpen ones.


### Version 2.3.4 from CPE 22.12 on

-   Trivial port of the 2.3.2 EasyConfig.
  
  
### Version 2.3.7 from LUMI/23.12 on

-   Trivial port of the 2.3.4 EasycConfig for LUMI/23.09, but added license information 
    to the installation.

-   Needed to upgrade to this version for compatibility with CCE 17.

-   2.3.8 was out for 25.03, but as 2025a was still using 2.3.7, we stuck to it.
