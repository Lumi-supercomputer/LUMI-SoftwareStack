# libgd license information

Libgd has a complicated license that can be found in the
[COPYING file in the source repository](https://github.com/libgd/libgd/blob/master/COPYING).

From LUMI/23.12 on, the license information can also be found in
`$EBROOTLIBGD/share/licenses/libgd` after loading the `libgd` module.
