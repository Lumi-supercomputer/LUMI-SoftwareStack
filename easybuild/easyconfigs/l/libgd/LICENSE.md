# libgd license information

Libgd has a complicated license that can be found in the
[COPYING file in the source repository](https://github.com/libgd/libgd/blob/master/COPYING).

From LUMI/23.12 on, the `COPYING` file can also be found in the
`$EBROOTLIBGD/share/licenses/libgd` subdirectory after loading the module.
