# NOTE: Can use libwebp too but then we have a circular dependency...
# NOTE: Also checks for JBIG-KIT. Since this library hasn't been updated
# since 2014 we do not include it, though the code is still used as part
# of some other tools (e.g., it is included in ImageMagick).
# NOTE: The configure routine also checks for OpenGL. Not clear which
# features this enables though...

description = """
This software provides support for the Tag Image File Format (TIFF), a widely
used format for storing image data. The latest version of the TIFF specification
is available on-line in several different formats.

Included in this software distribution is a library, libtiff, for reading and
writing TIFF, a small collection of tools for doing simple manipulations of TIFF
images, and documentation on the library and tools. Libtiff is a portable
software, it was built and tested on various systems: UNIX flavors (Linux, BSD,
Solaris, MacOS X), Windows, and OpenVMS. It should be possible to port libtiff
and additional tools on other OSes.

The library, along with associated tool programs, should handle most of your
needs for reading and writing TIFF images.
"""

usage = """
This package provides a number of command line tools:
+ fax2ps     - convert a TIFF facsimile to compressed PostScript
+ fax2tiff   - create a TIFF Class F fax file from raw fax data
+ pal2rgb    - convert a palette color TIFF image to a full color image
+ ppm2tiff   - create a TIFF file from PPM, PGM and PBM image files
+ raw2tiff   - create a TIFF file from a raw data
+ tiff2bw    - convert a color TIFF image to greyscale
+ tiff2pdf   - convert a TIFF image to a PDF document
+ tiff2ps    - convert a TIFF image to PostScript
+ tiff2rgba  - convert a TIFF image to RGBA color space
+ tiffcmp    - compare two TIFF files
+ tiffcp     - copy (and possibly convert) a TIFF file
+ tiffcrop   - select, copy, crop, convert, extract, and/or process one or more TIFF files.
+ tiffdither - convert a greyscale image to bilevel using dithering
+ tiffdump   - print verbatim information about TIFF files
+ tiffinfo   - print information about TIFF files
+ tiffmedian - apply the median cut algorithm to data in a TIFF file
+ tiffset    - set or unset a field in a TIFF header
+ tiffsplit  - split a multi-image TIFF into single-image TIFF files
Help for these tools is supplied via Linux man pages, and some tools support
the -help command line option.

The API is documented on the web and via Linux man pages. You can start
searching the latter via the entry page libtiffi (try man libtiff).
