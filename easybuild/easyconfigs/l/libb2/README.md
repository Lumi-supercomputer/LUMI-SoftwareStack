## EasyBuild

  * There is no support in the EasyBuilders repository

  * There is no support in the CSCS repository


### Version 0.98.1

  * The EasyConfig is an adaptation of an internal EasyConfig file from the
    University of Antwerpen. It is a straightforward configure - make - make
    install process.
    
  * For LUMI/23.12, added license information to the installation, and added
    the  `--enable-native=no` to ensure proper cross-compiling.
