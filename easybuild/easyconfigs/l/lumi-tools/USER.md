# lumi-tools user information

## lumi-workspaces

The `lumi-workspaces` command combines the `lumi-quota` and `lumi-allocations`
commands shown below, but is currently only capable to show the output for
all your workspaces/projects (user workspace on `/user`and the various project-related
workspaces on `/project`, `/scratch` and `/flash`).

Note that currently no output is displayed about storage use on the object file 
system as that one is still under development.

## lumi-quota

The `lumi-workspaces` command can be used to check your file quota on the 
system.

The command comes in three different forms:
  * `lumi-quota`         : Shows quota for all your workspaces (user and project)
  * `lumi-quota -v`      : Detailed quota information
  * `lumi-quota -p prj`  : Show quota of project prj

This tool only produces output about the Lustre file systems, so directories in
`/user`, `/project` (or the old name `/projappl`), `/scratch` and `/flash`.

## lumi-allocations

The `lumi-allocations` command can be used to check the status of your
allocations on LUMI.

-   To check all your remaining allocations, simply run
    `lumi-allocations`. (Does not yet work)
-   To check your allocation in your project_465000000 (replace with your project 
    number): `lumi-allocations -p project_465000000`
-   Use `lumi-allocations --help`
    for more informations.
