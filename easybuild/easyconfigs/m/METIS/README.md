METIS is mature code, there doesn't really seem much development anymore.
The 5.1.0 release is from 2013, but then there was a 5.2.1 release onb GitHub.


## EasyBuild

-   [METIS support in the EasyBuilders repository](https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyconfigs/tree/develop/easybuild/easyconfigs/m/METIS)

    METIS has a software-specific EasyBlock.

-   [METIS support in the CSCS repository](https://github.com/eth-cscs/production/tree/master/easybuild/easyconfigs/m/METIS)

-   [HPE-Cray METIS sample build script (TPSL)](https://github.com/Cray/pe-scripts/blob/master/sh/tpsl/metis.sh)

    METIS was part of the Cray Third-Party Scientific Libraries (TPSL) but is no longer
    delivered in a ready-to-use form,


### Version 5.1.0 from CPE 21.08 on

-   Our EasyConfig is derived from the CSCS one which itself is a direct
    adaptation of the EasyBuilders one.

    It uses the default EasyBuild METIS EasyBlock.

-   For LUMI/23.12, license information was added to the installation.

-   LUMI/25.03: There is a new version available at https://github.com/KarypisLab/METIS
    but so far we failed to build it as it seems to have new dependencies (at least, it
    cannot find a certain header file) and as we are concerned that dependencies cannot
    yet use that new version. We did update all URLs though as the old URLs in the 
    EasyConfig no longer existed.


### Version 5.1.0 with precision versionsuffix from 25.03 on

-   Thanks to a user ticket, we found out that METIS and ParMETIS (which uses a built-in METIS)
    used a different precision for the floating point data, and nothing in the module name indicated
    that. So we have made the EasyConfig more universal, making it easy to select the precision for
    the indices and the real data format, and also reflect that choice in the versionsuffix and document
    it in the module help.

    So rather than a patch which was used by EasyBuilders in their METIS EasyConfig we work with a `sed`
    to edit the `metis.h` header file. The procedure could actually be done in a modified EasyBlock, but
    we want to continue using the standard EasyBlock with just a small patch.

    We did need to patch the EasyBlock for METIS as it did not honour `preconfigopts`.
