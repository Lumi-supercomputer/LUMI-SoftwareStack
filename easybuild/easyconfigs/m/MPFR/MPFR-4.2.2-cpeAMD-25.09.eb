description = """
The MPFR library is a C library for multiple-precision floating-point
computations with correct rounding. MPFR is based on the GMP multiple-precision
library.

The main goal of MPFR is to provide a library for multiple-precision
floating-point computation which is both efficient and has a well-defined
semantics. It copies the good ideas from the ANSI/IEEE-754 standard for
double-precision floating-point arithmetic (53-bit significand).

MPFR is free. It is distributed under the GNU Lesser General Public License
(GNU Lesser GPL), version 3 or later.\

The module provides both static and shared libraries.

NOTE: When running the included tests, two tests are skipped when using
Clang-based compilers so the library may be less complete than the
cpeGNU-based one. Moreover, in CCE 17 three other tests fail.
