## Issues

-   mpdecimal does build a mpc.pc file for pkg-config (at least not in 2.5.1 or earlier)


## EasyBuild

-   There is no support for mpdecimal in the EasyBuilders repository

-   There is no support for mpdecimal in the CSCS repository


### Version 2.5.1 from CPE 21.06 on

-   The EasyConfig is a direct port of the one of the University of Antwerpen.
  
-   For LUMI/23.12, license information was added to the installation.


### Version 4.0.0 from LUMI/24.03 on

-   Trivial port of the EasyConfig for 2.5.1 for LUMI/23.12.
    The license file has changed though.
  
-   Improved sanity checks as the installation now also prepares files
    for `pkg-config`.


### Version 4.0.1 from 25.03 on

-   Trivial port of the EasyConfig for 4.0.1 for 24.03/24.11.
