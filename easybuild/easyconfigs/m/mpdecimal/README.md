## Issues

  * mpdecimal does build a mpc.pc file for pkg-config (at least not in 2.5.1 or earlier)


## EasyBuild

  * There is no support for MPC in the EasyBuilders repository

  * There is no support for MPC in the CSCS repository


### Version 2.5.1 from CPE 21.06 on

  * The EasyConfig is a direct port of the one of the University of Antwerpen.

  
### Version 4.0.0 from CVPE 23.12 on

  * Trivial port of the EasyConfig for 2.5.1.
  
  * Now also copy some license information to the installation directories.
  
  * Improved sanity checks.
