description = """
mpdecimal is a package for correctly-rounded arbitrary precision decimal
floating point arithmetic. Starting from version 2.4.0, mpdecimal includes
only the libmpdec library. Further mpdecimal development will focus
exclusively on libmpdec.

libmpdec is a complete implementation of the General Decimal Arithmetic
Specification. The specification, written by Mike Cowlishaw from IBM,
defines a general purpose arbitrary precision data type together with
rigorously specified functions and rounding behavior. As described in the
scope section of the specification, libmpdec will - with minor restrictions -
also conform to the IEEE 754-2008 Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic,
provided that the appropriate context parameters are set.

libmpdec is written in C, but the header files are prepared for use with a
C++ compiler. It is intended to be cross platform and has been tested on
64/32-bit Linux, 64/32-bit FreeBSD and OpenBSD, 64/32-bit Windows,
64-bit AIX, 64/32-bit OpenSolaris and 32-bit Debian Mips.

Starting from Python-3.3, libmpdec is the basis for Python’s decimal module.
