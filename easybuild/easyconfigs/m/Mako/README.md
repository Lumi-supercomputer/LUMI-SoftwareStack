## EasyBuild

-   [Support for Mako in the EasyBuilders repository](https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyconfigs/tree/develop/easybuild/easyconfigs/m/Mako)
    
-   [Support for Mako in the CSCS repository](https://github.com/eth-cscs/production/tree/master/easybuild/easyconfigs/m/Mako)
    
    
### Version 1.3.5 for CPE 24.03

-   Based on previous easyconfigs in the contrib repository that were created from 
    scratch as the LUMI Python setup is different from the
    EasyBuilders and CSCS ones. 


### Version 1.3.10 for CPE 25.03

-   Almost trivial port of the EasyConfig for 1.3.5 in 24.03, but needed to add
    source lines as it appears the names of the source tars have changed.
